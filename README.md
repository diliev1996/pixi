# PixiJs Job interview assignment

Implementation of the job interview assigment. The ball bounces up and down the screen in an endless loop. 

It starts with initial speed of 1,which is also the minimal to keep the ball moving,but it can be modified,with the plus and minus buttons on the left.
With a speed of 0, the ball stops moving while the top speed is 20. 

To run the project, copy the repository, run 'npm install' and then 'npm start'.
