# PixiJs Job interview assignment

Implementation of the job interview assigment.

There are 4 elements on the screen - 2 buttons for regulating the speed, the ball and a text displaying the current speed.

The ball starts with initial speed of 1,which is also the minimal to keep the ball moving, and downwards direction. Everytime the ball hits a wall it bounces back with the same speed in an endless loop. 

The speed can be modified with the plus and minus buttons on the left. The text gets updated everytime the either one of the buttons is clicked.

With a speed of 0 the ball stops moving while the top speed is 20. 

To run the project simply copy the repository, run 'npm install' and then 'npm start'. This will open a broser window, where the animacation can be seen. 

The only dependencies are pixi.js and browser-sync.
